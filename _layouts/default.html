				<h2 class="claim">Applications should be good citizens on the platforms they run on:</h2>
				<p>This means following the operating systems' rules regarding the location of configuration, cache files and other application data.</p>
				<p>This in turn allows vastly simplified management of our data:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Easily moving between different machines, carrying your configuration with you.</li>
					<li>Backing up all crucial files, without the needless copying of caches.</li>
					<li>Evicting caches with the assurance that no critical data is lost.</li>
				</ul>
				<br/>
				<p>But as each operating system invented its own set of rules, this is easier said than done.</p>
				<br/>
				<p>This website provides resources to developers that helps them write applications that adhere to the standards of the operating system they are running on.</p>
